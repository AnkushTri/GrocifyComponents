            In certain cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement
            for any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given.

          <p>
            In cases where a product accessory is found
            missing/damaged/defective, the seller may either process a
            replacement of the particular accessory or issue an eGV for an
            amount equivalent to the price of the accessory, at the seller’s
            discretion.

          <p>
            During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if you
            received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a
            refund (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you
            have accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be
            processed, except for manufacturing defects. In such cases, these
            category-specific replacement/return general conditions will be
            applicable. <a href="#">Click here</a> to know more about Open Box

            authorised personnel shall help in unboxing and installation of the
            product.

          <p>
            For Furniture, any product-related issues will be checked by
            authorised service personnel (free of cost) and attempted to be
            resolved by replacing the faulty/ defective part of the product.
            Full replacement will be provided only in cases where the service
            personnel opines that replacing the faulty/defective part will not
